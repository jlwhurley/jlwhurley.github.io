        <p class = "entry">I'm headed out to play tennis today. It's been awhile - not really, I played on Tuesday. But it's definitely been a while since I was any good. Sure hope I play well today or I may have to choose a different hobby (perhaps programming). I made a really interesting thai peanut chicken in the crockpot for dinner. If you'd like to try it <a href = "https://dinnerthendessert.com/slow-cooker-thai-peanut-chicken/">HERE's</a> the recipe. </p>

        <p class = "entry">The Mark Friday tennis tournament is today. Alot of fun playing a round robin style of tennis. I'd love to win but I'm definitely  not the cream of the 4.0 crop.You can learn more about the tournament <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.lnta.org/events/2nd-annual-mark-friday-memorial-tournament/">HERE</a>.</p>
